# About Me
**Hello, my name is Miguel Teixeira, and I am a Computer Engineering student at IFMG Bambuí. I have a strong interest in programming and digital design, especially in game development. Throughout my studies, I’ve learned to work with languages such as Java, HTML, CSS, Python, and MySQL. I also enjoy creating both pixel art and digital drawings, using tools like Aseprite and Photoshop to design my own artwork.
